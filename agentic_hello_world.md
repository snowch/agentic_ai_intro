# Building Intelligent Agents with LangChain: A Practical Guide

## How Agentic AI Works
Before diving into the code, let's visualize how an agentic AI system operates:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Input] -->|Triggers| B[Decision Making<br/>[LLM]]
    B -->|Choose Tool| C[Tool Usage]
    B -->|Direct Response| E[End]
    C -->|Update State| D[Next Step Decision<br/>[LLM]]
    D -->|Continue| B
    D -->|Complete| E
    
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#96f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

This workflow illustrates the three key capabilities that make an AI system "agentic":

1. **Autonomous Decision Making** (shown in pink): The LLM evaluates input and decides what to do next
2. **Tool Usage** (shown in purple): The system can use external tools to accomplish tasks
3. **Multi-Step Task Execution** (shown in orange): The system can chain multiple actions together

## What Makes AI "Agentic"?
An AI system becomes "agentic" when it possesses these three key capabilities:

1. **Autonomous Decision Making**: The ability to decide what actions to take based on input and context
2. **Tool Usage**: The capacity to use external tools or functions to accomplish tasks
3. **Multi-Step Task Execution**: The ability to chain multiple actions together in a meaningful sequence

These three capabilities transform a passive language model into an active agent that can operate with meaningful autonomy. Let's see how each piece of our implementation contributes to these core capabilities.

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Setting Up the Environment
```bash
pip install langchain langchain-core langchain-ollama langgraph
```

### 2. Defining Agent State
```python
from typing import TypedDict, Sequence
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Sequence[HumanMessage | AIMessage]
    next: str
```
**Agentic Capability: Multi-Step Task Execution**
- This state management enables the agent to maintain context across multiple steps
- Tracks the sequence of actions and their results
- Enables the agent to make decisions based on previous steps

### 3. Creating Tools
```python
from langchain_core.tools import tool

@tool
def say_hello(name: str) -> str:
    """Says hello to the provided name."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```
**Agentic Capability: Tool Usage**
- Defines external functions that the agent can invoke
- Provides structured interfaces for agent actions
- Enables the agent to affect its environment

### 4. Implementing the Decision Engine
```python
def call_model(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """Call the model to get the next action."""
    messages = state['messages']
    prompt = f"""You are a helpful assistant that MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON.

    You have access to this tool:
    say_hello: A tool that says hello to a name

    EXAMPLES:
    User: Please say hello to Bob
    Response: {{"tool": "say_hello", "tool_input": "Bob"}}

    User: What's the weather?
    Response: {{"final_answer": "I apologize, but I don't have access to weather information."}}

    RULES:
    1. Respond with ONLY JSON
    2. No explanations or extra text
    3. Use EXACTLY one of these formats:
       {{"tool": "say_hello", "tool_input": "<name>"}}
       {{"final_answer": "<your response>"}}

    Current request: {messages[-1].content}
    """

    try:
        response = llm.invoke(prompt).strip()
        parsed_response = json.loads(response)
        state['next'] = 'call_tool' if "tool" in parsed_response else END
        state['messages'].append(AIMessage(content=json.dumps(parsed_response)))
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error("Error processing LLM response: %s", e)
        state['messages'].append(AIMessage(content=json.dumps({
            "final_answer": "I encountered an error while processing your request."
        })))
        state['next'] = END

    return state
```
**Agentic Capability: Autonomous Decision Making**
- LLM evaluates input and decides whether to use tools or respond directly
- Structured prompt guides decision-making process
- Error handling allows for autonomous recovery from failures

### 5. Tool Execution Layer
```python
def call_tool(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """Execute the tool based on the model's decision."""
    last_message = state['messages'][-1]

    try:
        parsed_content = json.loads(last_message.content)
        if "tool" in parsed_content and parsed_content["tool"] == "say_hello":
            tool_input = parsed_content.get("tool_input", "")
            if tool_input:
                result = say_hello(tool_input)
                state['messages'].append(AIMessage(content=json.dumps({
                    "final_answer": result
                })))
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error("Error executing tool: %s", e)
        state['messages'].append(AIMessage(content=json.dumps({
            "final_answer": f"Error executing tool: {str(e)}"
        })))

    state['next'] = END
    return state
```
**Agentic Capabilities: Tool Usage & Multi-Step Task Execution**
- Executes tools based on previous decisions
- Updates state with results
- Maintains execution chain across steps

### 6. Workflow Definition
```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
workflow.add_node("call_model", call_model)
workflow.add_node("call_tool", call_tool)
workflow.add_edge("call_model", "call_tool")
workflow.add_edge("call_model", END)
workflow.add_edge("call_tool", END)
workflow.set_entry_point("call_model")

chain = workflow.compile()
```
**Agentic Capability: Multi-Step Task Execution**
- Defines the possible sequences of actions
- Enables complex multi-step workflows
- Coordinates decision-making and tool usage

Here's how these components work together to create agentic behavior:

```mermaid
graph TD
A[User Input] -->|Triggers| B[Decision Making<br/>[LLM]]
B -->|Choose Tool| C[Tool Usage]
B -->|Direct Response| E[End]
C -->|Update State| D[Next Step Decision<br/>[LLM]]
D -->|Continue| B
D -->|Complete| E
```

## Building More Complex Agents

To enhance these core agentic capabilities, consider:

1. **Enhanced Decision Making**
   - Multiple decision steps
   - Complex reasoning chains
   - Priority-based action selection

2. **Expanded Tool Sets**
   - API interactions
   - Database operations
   - File system tools
   - External service integration

3. **Advanced Multi-Step Execution**
   - Parallel action execution
   - Conditional branching
   - Loop constructs
   - Error recovery paths

## Best Practices for Agentic AI Development

1. **Decision Making**
   - Clear decision criteria
   - Structured prompt design
   - Robust error handling
   - Fallback mechanisms

2. **Tool Integration**
   - Atomic tool design
   - Clear documentation
   - Input validation
   - Error boundaries

3. **Multi-Step Processing**
   - State immutability
   - Clear step transitions
   - Progress tracking
   - Recovery mechanisms

## Conclusion
Building effective agentic AI requires careful implementation of all three key capabilities:
1. Autonomous decision-making through well-structured prompts and LLM integration
2. Tool usage through clear interfaces and robust execution
3. Multi-step task execution through state management and workflow definition

When these elements work together, they create an AI system that can operate with meaningful autonomy while maintaining reliability and predictability.
